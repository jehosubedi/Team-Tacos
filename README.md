We are modifying the ERPNext system, built on the Frappe framework, and integrating changes into a centralized repository for our group project. This repository enables efficient collaboration, customization, and development to meet project objectives.

Key features include:

COLLABORATION: Supports team contributions and conflict-free development.

CUSTOMIZATION: Enables modifications and new feature creation.

DOCUMENTATION: Hosts technical guides, workflows, and user resources.

VERSION CONTROL: Tracks changes and manages code versions.

DEPLOYMENT: Ensures stable, organized deployment with a clear development history.

This setup ensures a systematic approach to modifying the ERPNext system while maintaining team efficiency and project alignment.
